If the shipping tag is separated from your dewar this information will help the carrier contact you.

Dewar Hygiene
-------------

Periodically dry out your dewar by blowing dry air into the bottom of the dewar.
This will help get any residual water out of the adsorbant and help to reduce
ice formation in your dewar.

If you can tip a warm dewar upside down and white powder comes out, you should discard
your dewar. The white powder is the adsorbant coming out of the dewar and if enough of
it is lost, it will fail to keep the dewar cold for an extended amount of time. This
silica powder will also get on surfaces at the beamline and is very difficult to to remove.

.. admonition:: Note

    Dewars that arrive with serious adsorbant leakage will be immediately returned.
