Sample Requirements
===================

.. admonition:: Warning
   :class: danger

   Nonconforming samples will not be placed in the robot or mounted by hand
   on the goniometer. These samples will be returned to the user.

Puck Requirements
-----------------

.. admonition:: Note

   - ONLY UniPuck V1 pucks are supported.
   - No other puck types will be loaded in the robot.
   - Samples will not be moved to UniPucks by staff.


The majority of UniPucks available from reputable sellers are V1 pucks.
The telling feature of these pucks is the hole pattern in the base plate
as shown in the accompanying figure.

    UniPuck V1 base plate features. Red arrows indicate required holes.

When ordering pucks we recommend having them named according to the lab they
originated from, for example, CHL-XXX in the image above. This will help the beamline staff
ensure that pucks are returned to their proper owner.

We also suggest that the 2D barcode be added as an option to the pucks. These
bar codes are being used to track pucks at a number of beamlines world-wide.

The last option is to have different colors used instead of black. This isn't
required, but can also be helpful to set apart pucks from different labs if
they are different colors.

Custom names, bar codes and colors shouldn't add any cost to the price of the pucks.

Base Requirements
-----------------

SPINE, ALS and SAM bases can be used with the robot. We recommend SPINE bases to maintain compatibility with the other NSLS-II beamlines.

2D bar codes are not required. If you need them for your internal tracking, we suggest
using bases that have the bar code laser etched from MiTeGen or Molecular Dimensions. The
painted bar codes from Hampton Research can reduce sample mounter reliability.

The MiTeGen reusable bases are only compatible with MiTeGen pins. Using other pins
can result in sample loss.

Pin Requirements
----------------

Pin length should be standard 18mm (22mm overall mounted).

If you buy pins from MiTeGen, Molecular Dimensions or Hampton, they will come at a standard 18mm unless you
specify something different.

Sample Hygiene
-------------

Shipping Dewars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Periodically dry out your dewar by blowing dry air into the bottom of the dewar.
  This will help get any residual water out of the adsorbant and help to reduce
  ice formation in your dewar.

* If you can tip a warm dewar upside down and white powder comes out, you should discard
  your dewar. The white powder is the adsorbant coming out of the dewar and if enough of
  it is lost, it will fail to keep the dewar cold for an extended amount of time. This
  silica powder will also get on surfaces at the beamline and is very difficult to to remove.


.. admonition:: Warning
   :class: danger

   Any dewar that arrives with serious adsorbant leakage will be immediately returned.

Pucks
~~~~~

* Make sure that the center post on the puck lid is secure. You may need to periodically
  tighten the screw that holds the post on. If the post falls out, then we can't separate the puck.

* Make sure that the spring clips that hold the lid and base together are appropriately tensioned.
  If they are too loose, the puck is difficult to remove from the robot dewar. If they are too tight,
  the lid is difficult to put back on. New clips can be purchased from `Crystal Positioning Systems
  <https://www.crystalpositioningsystems.com/product/puck-clip-20pk/>`__.

* Periodically clean the pucks to remove any adsorbant, grease, crystallant solution, etc.

* Be sure to remove fragments of pins magnetically attached to the pucks. These pin fragments run the
  risk of causing robot or goniometer malfunctions.


Sample Pins
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Discard rusty or damaged bases

* Ensure that the pins are fixed into the base and will survive thermal cycling. If the pin becomes
  loose after thermal cycling, you run the risk of sample loss.

* Use clean bases. Be sure you are not getting crystallant solution or grease on your bases while preparing
  your samples.

* Ice on the base will cause problems centering and possibly goniometer mount failures. Be sure there is
  very little ice build-up in your working environment when preparing your samples.
