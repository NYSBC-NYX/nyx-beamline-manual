Sample Requirements
===================

.. admonition:: Warning

   Nonconforming samples will not be placed in the robot or mounted by hand
   on the goniometer. These samples will be returned to the user.

Puck Requirements
-----------------

.. admonition:: Attention

   - ONLY UniPuck V1 pucks are supported.
   - No other puck types will be loaded in the robot.
   - Samples will not be moved to UniPucks by staff.


The majority of UniPucks available from reputable sellers are V1 pucks.
The telling feature of these pucks is the hole pattern in the base plate
as shown in the accompanying figure.

When ordering pucks we recommend having them named according to the lab they
originated from, for example, CHL-XXX in the image above. This will help the beamline staff
ensure that pucks are returned to their proper owner.

We also suggest that the 2D barcode be added as an option to the pucks. These
bar codes are being used to track pucks at a number of beamlines world-wide.

The last option is to have different colors used instead of black. This isn't
required, but can also be helpful to set apart pucks from different labs if
they are different colors.

Custom names, bar codes and colors shouldn't add any cost to the price of the pucks.

Base Requirements
-----------------

SPINE, ALS and SAM bases can be used with the robot. We recommend SPINE bases to maintain compatibility with the other NSLS-II beamlines.

2D bar codes are not required. If you need them for your internal tracking, we suggest
using bases that have the bar code laser etched from MiTeGen or Molecular Dimensions. The
painted bar codes from Hampton Research can reduce sample mounter reliability.

The MiTeGen reusable bases are only compatible with MiTeGen pins. Using other pins
can result in sample loss.

Pin Requirements
----------------

Pin length should be standard 18mm (22mm overall mounted).

If you buy pins from MiTeGen, Molecular Dimensions or Hampton, they will come at a standard 18mm unless you
specify something different.
